# Functional Testing 

#### The content of the Functional Testing is summarized in the following index file:
- [Index](./ConnectionPreparation+test.functional.index.yaml)

#### Details on the individual testcases can be found here:
- [Completeness](./completeness/)  
  All individual services are tested for providing a ResponseCode different from 404.  
  (The usual validation for ResponseCode 204 or 200 with the correct ResponseBody cannot be applied as proprietary management interfaces cannot be simulated.)
- [Device Communication](./deviceComm/)  
  EaTL records are used to validate device specific communication
