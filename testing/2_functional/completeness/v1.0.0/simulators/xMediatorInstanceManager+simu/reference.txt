The xMediatorInstanceManager+simu.yaml simulator has been created and used for testing the 
testcase collection for completeness of the xMediatorInstanceManager during its development.  

It could be used for creating a sandbox while testing the MediatorManager for completeness, too.  

For avoiding decoupling from potential correction or expansion of the simulator, just a reference
instead of a copy is provided here.

Please, find it here for creating an own copy before putting own testcase of the MediatorManager on top:
